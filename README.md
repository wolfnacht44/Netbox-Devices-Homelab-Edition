# Netbox Devices (HomeLab Edition)
 This is a little repo I'm putting together for those who utilize Netbox in their homelabs, or smaller production environments.

## How to Use
 * It's super easy! Simply navigate to the device you require, and download the corresponding files.
 * MY *personal* method, is to simply clone the entire repo and upload the files as I need them, I think its easier.

# Regarding features, bugs, and PRs
 1. This is a project I am doing in my free time! I will update it as I plug along with the oddball stuff I stumble upon and expand on.
 2. You are MORE than welcome to submit feedback, requests, and even submit PRs to add new devices!
     - IF you submit a PR to add a new device, PLEASE be as detailed and accurate as possible! Also don't hesistate to check to see if your device is in a pending PR.
     - IF you submit a PR to correct a device, please include the correction in the comment. I will do my best to sort these out and verify
 3. I can't promise anything, but I will do my best to keep up with the repo as Netbox Updates, and as devices change. I personally run more of a "budget" lab, with dated hardware, but I will do my best to keep up with devices typically not found in the [Main Repo](https://github.com/netbox-community/devicetype-library)

### Disclaimer
* Just be aware I DO work a full time job and have a family, I don't have much in the way of free time, but as stated prior, I will do my best to keep up! I hope anyone who stumbles across this page finds it useful.
* There MAY be some overlap between this repo and the Netbox Repo, Some devices may be directly copied from their repo, or others, I'll include an external sources *.txt as this gets built out. Simple fact, there's no point in literally "re-inventing the wheel". This is just to serve as a collection for the people with more of the oddball and dated hardware. 
* Furthermore I am in no way shape or form associated with "Netbox" in anyway.
